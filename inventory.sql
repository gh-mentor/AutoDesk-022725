- address: 255 characters, nullable
- city: 50 characters, not null
- state: 2 characters, not null
- zip: 10 characters, not null
4) Create the 'categories' table with a one-to-many relation to the 'suppliers'. Use the following columns:
- id:  integer, primary key
- name: 50 characters, not null
- description:  255 characters, nullable
- supplier_id: int, foreign key references suppliers(id)
